Slides have been mostly compiled and edited from two sources:
<ul>
    <li>The ARRL slides that accompany the 5th edition of the ARRL Technician License Manual</li>
    <li>Professor Pauly, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford, who runs an intro-to-ham class and whose slides are really excellent.</li>
</ul>

    <b> NOTE: Our March 9th class has been moved to 3pm due to the PMC Town Hall.</b>

<b>Recommended Study Method</b>
To memorize the questions and answers for the test, we recommend the following
<ol>
    <li>Read the question</li>
    <li>Read <b>ONLY</b> the correct answer.  Highlight it somehow.  Do not read the other answers - they are distractions.</li>
    <li>Repeat for all questions as long as it takes to recognize most of the correct answers.</li>
</ol>

Our brains are very good at <em>recognition.</em>  So what the above process does is help you to <em>recognize</em> the correct answer.
